  Delete node_modules folders in the PWD present working dir and in any

More often than not in a monorepo, I have to delete node_modules folders in the PWD present working dir and in any directories inside it. 



üõ† Here's how I do it

```
find . -name "node_modules" -exec rm -rf '{}' +
```

‚ö°Ô∏è Better add this in your ZSH/Bash profile.
